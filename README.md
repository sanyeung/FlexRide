# FlexRide
A flexible ridesharing project

The current code in the folder (should) contains the code for the project published as: 
  S. Yeung, E. Miller and S. Madria, "A Flexible Real-Time Ridesharing System Considering Current Road Conditions," 2016 17th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM), Porto, Portugal, 2016, pp. 186-191.
  
* Note that the foundational code is based off on the simulation code here: https://github.com/uakfdotb/tsharesim
  So it might be beneficial to be familiar with that code first.
