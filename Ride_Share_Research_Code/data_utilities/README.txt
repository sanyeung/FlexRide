The programs in this directory allow conversion from a road network generated by the Minnesota Traffic Generator to a readable format for the simulator.

Before beginning, place the vertices and edges text files in the input directory.

1. run "./coordinate_parser", this will create two files in the output folder (vertices.out and edges.out)

2. run "java GraphUtil output/vertices.out output/edges.out togra output/edges.gra", this will create another file in the output folder (edges.gra)

3. copy vertices.out,edges.out, and edges.gra to the tsharesim/first_graph folder so they can be used with the simulator

Note: right now there is a Hong Kong data set in the input folder that is way too big to use, so the Rolla data set is the one that is actually in the simulator's first_graph folder)
